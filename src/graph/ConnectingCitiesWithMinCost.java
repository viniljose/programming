/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/connecting-cities-with-minimum-cost/
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-cost-connect-cities/
 * There are n cities labeled from 1 to n. You are given the integer n and an array connections where connections[i] = [xi, yi, costi] indicates that the cost of connecting city xi and city yi (bidirectional connection) is costi.
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to connect all the n cities such that there is at least one path between each pair of cities. If it is impossible to connect all the n cities, return -1,
 *
 * The cost is the sum of the connections' costs used.
 * Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
 * Output: 6
