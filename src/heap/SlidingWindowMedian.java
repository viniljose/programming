 * Given an integer array, nums, and an integer, k, there is a sliding window of size k, which is moving from
 * the very left to the very right of the array. We can only see the k numbers in the window.
 * Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
 *
 * Given this scenario, return the median of the each window.
