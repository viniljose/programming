/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/description/
 * A busy investor with an initial capital, w, needs an automated investment program.
 * They can select k distinct projects from a list of n projects with corresponding capitals requirements
 * and expected profits. For a given project i, its capital requirement is capitals[i],
 * and the profit it yields is profits[i].
 *
 * The goal is to maximize their cumulative capital by selecting a maximum of k distinct projects to invest in,
 * subject to the constraint that the investorâ€™s current capital must be greater than or equal to the capital
 * requirement of all selected projects.
 *
 * When a selected project from the identified ones is finished, the pure profit from the project,
 * along with the starting capital of that project is returned to the investor.
 * This amount will be added to the total capital held by the investor.
 * Now, the investor can invest in more projects with the new total capital.
 * It is important to note that each project can only be invested once.
